            The need for women's rights is beyond the right to own property or vote. It is the fight for women to be considered a <b> equal</b> individual to men. The rights to own property in their own name, to secure an education, to vote and hold office, to plan their families and control their reproductive lives.

            One of the main goals is<b> breaking the social cotsructs</b>.The women's movement pushed for a rethinking of gender roles. Feminists pointed out that housework was not intrinsically womanly, but social norms had constructed what was considered<i> "woman's work".</i> Also, many claimed that society did not value <i>"women's work"</i> as much as it did men's. Traditional housekeeping and childrearing are largely accomplished in the confines of the house. The work is unpaid, and women are dependent on a man, typically their husband. This social structure is especially difficult for widowed or divorced women.

            The women's movement strives for social acceptance of variety personal and professional choices that women make. An ideal goal is the death of social stigmas for female sexuality, for women who choose not to marry or have children, and for women who work outside the home as well as those who choose to be stay-at-home mothers.
